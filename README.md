**SnapLayoutKit** is a lightweight Swift framework (<300 lines) that lets you create _Auto Layout_ constraints programmatically. The framework extends `UIView` with wrapper functions, that does not conflict with your current constraints in the project. The methods are chainable resulting in an ease with setting up your UI.

## Features
